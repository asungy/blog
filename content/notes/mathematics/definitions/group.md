## Definition
A **group**  is a set \(G\), together with a binary operator \(\star\), satisfying  the following conditions:
1. \(a \star b \in G\) for all \(a,b \in G\) (closure).
2. \((a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c)\) for all \(a,b,c \in G\) (associativity).
3. There exists an \(e \in G\) such that \(a \star e = e \star a = a\) for all \(a \in G\) (existence of identity).
4. For each \(a \in G\), there exists a \(b \in G\) such that \(a \star b = b \star a = e\) (existence of inverses).
