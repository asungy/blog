### Problem 1

Evaluate

\[
  \int_{S}\int \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\,dA = \int_{R}\int \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot \mathbf{N}(u,v)\,du\,dv
\]

when \(\mathbf{F} = \left[x^2,\,0,\,3y^2\right]\) and \(S\) is the portion of the plane \(x+y+z=1\) in the first octant.

We are going to work on developing and evaluating the left-side of the equation \(\int_{R}\int \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot \mathbf{N}(u,v)\,du\,dv\).

The first thing we need to do is parameterize the surface \(S = x + y + z = 1\) in terms of \(u\) and \(v\).

Let,

- \(x = u\)
- \(y = v\)
- \(z = 1-x-y = 1-u-v\)

So we have

\[
  \mathbf{r}(u,v) = \left[u,\,v,\,1-u-v\right]
\]

Note that at this step, we should also determine the bounds that we are integrating over for \(u\) and \(v\). Based on \(S\) and the image, we know we have a plane restricted to the first quadrant. If we look at \(\int_{R}\int \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot \mathbf{N}(u,v)\,du\,dv\), we notice that the outer integration is \(v\) which is a parameter for \(y\), so we need to make sure our bounds are independent of any of the other variables. If we set \(z = 0\), we can see in the image that the bounds on the \(xy\)-plane is \(x+y=1\). \(x\) cannot be negative, so we know that \(0 \leq y \leq 1\).

Now, we need to determine the bounds for inner integration with respect to \(u\). \(u=x\) and just like \(y\) is restricted to the same plane when \(z=0\). In theory we know that \(0 \leq x \leq 1\), but we need to make sure this bounds is dependent on \(y\) because the bounds \(x+y=1\) makes \(x\) dependent on \(y\). The bounds for \(x\) would be \(0 \leq x \leq 1-y\).

So we have the bounds:
- \(0 \leq x \leq 1-y\)
- \(0 \leq y \leq 1\)

In terms of \(u\) and \(v\), this would look like:
- \(0 \leq u \leq 1-v\)
- \(0 \leq v \leq 1\)

So now that we have our integration bounds, the next thing we can try to figure out is what \(\mathbf{r}(u,v)\) is in the expression \(\int_{R}\int \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot \mathbf{N}(u,v)\,du\,dv\). Well \(\mathbf{r}(u,v)\) is just our parameterizations of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of \(u\) and \(v\).

So \(\mathbf{r}(u,v) = \left[u,\,v,\,1-u-v\right]\).

Now that we have \(\mathbf{r}(u,v)\), we can now solve for \(\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v\). \(\mathbf{r}_u\) and \(\mathbf{r}_v\) are just the derivatives of \(\mathbf{r}\) with respect to \(u\) and \(v\).

- \(\mathbf{r}_u = \left[1,\,0,\,-1\right]\)
- \(\mathbf{r}_v = \left[0,\,1,\,-1\right]\)

So

\[
   \mathbf{N} = 
\]

### Problem 2

Evaluate the integral for the given data. Describe the kind of surface.

\[
  \mathbf{F} = \left[0,x,0\right],\: S:\,x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = 1,\; x \geq 0,\, y\geq 0,\,z\geq 0
\]
