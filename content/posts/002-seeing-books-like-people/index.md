I remember when I was in middle school I had a stack of books on the side of my desk. It had all sorts of books with no sense of cohesion. The only common thread was that they were able to capture my interest in someway. Every time I sat down to read, I would take the first book from the stack, and when I was done reading, I'd place it back on top. Whenever I finished a book, I would return it to my bookshelf and start on the next one on the stack.

My stack of books was never too short nor too tall. I would always try to work my way from the top and also occasionally supply new books at the bottom. It was a beautifully simple and dynamic system and I found great satisfaction in attending to it, almost like a person caring for their garden.

It is now 2025 and the last book I read was three years ago.

Sometimes I think back on my youth and wonder if that boy would be mournful of the person I have become. Granted, with a full-time job and a family, I certainly have less free time now than I did 17 years ago. I think the young boy could be understanding of this. But I think his forgiveness would end at the _way_ I approach reading now.

When I walk into a bookstore, the innocent and curious questions that I used to once ask no longer seem to bubble from within me. Rather, it's as if I almost know the contents of the book before reading it; that based on the back cover that this book will be too simplistic for my liking, or that the table of contents suggest it wouldn't be useful enough to me, or that the writing style indicates a certain level of complexity that I don't have the energy for. For some reason, when it comes to reading, I become judgemental and dismissive. One would suspect that I had a traumatic, physical altercation with a book in my past.

But today I considered for a moment as if these books were people and it contents were potential conversations. Rather than a bookstore with bookshelves, I imagined walking into a coffee shop with various people sitting silently by themselves and before them was an empty seat. The way I approached books would be like taking a seat in front of these people expecting to learn something from them without first even engaging in an introduction of any sort. I was coming up to the table like an entitled asshole, demanding their utility to me only to treat their time like plasticware.

Then I had another thought. I imagined walking into another coffee shop but instead of people sitting quietly alone, they were eagerly rushing up all at once to tell or sell me something, unsolicitedly. I'd probably try to run out of that coffee shop as fast I could. But ironcally, my phone does the same thing and yet I entertain oncoming assault.

I seem to have conditioned myself to only consume the monologues that present themselve before me.

Perhaps the reason books appear silent to me is because I'm the one who has failed to show up and engage in a dialogue.
